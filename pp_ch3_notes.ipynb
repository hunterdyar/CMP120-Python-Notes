    "### Namespaces and Scope\n",
    "Let's explain this concept of scope in more detail. In python namespaces are containers for mapping names to objects. The mapping allows us to access an object, such as an integer, a string or a function, by the name that has been assigned to it. Now, the tricky part is that we have multiple independent namespaces in Python, and names can be reused for different namespaces (only the objects to which the names refer are unique). The namespaces are structured in a certain hierarchy, which brings us to the concept of *scope*. The scope in Python defines the hierarchy level in which we search namespaces for name-to-object mappings. Python searches for names in the following order:\n",
    "* first in the most local namespace that is running (typically a function) \n",
    "* then moves outward to the next namespace, typically the global namespace (where the main program is running)\n",
    "* then to the namespace for builtin functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if a function is executing, function's namespace is the first namespace searched. If the name is not found there the calling environment, which is usually the global environment, is searched. If the name is not found then the built-ins are searched next.\n",
